1. T2M (Temperature at 2 meters above ground level): This tells us how warm or cold the air is about two meters above the ground, which is about the height of a person. If it says 20°C, it’s like a nice, warm day.
2. PRECTOT (Total precipitation): This tells us how much rain (or snow) has fallen. If it says 10 mm, it means there was a little bit of rain, like the amount in a small cup.
3. RH2M (Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground level): This is a way to tell how much moisture is in the air. If it’s 50%, it’s like saying half of the air is made up of water. On a hot day, if this number is high, it can feel sticky or sweaty!
4. WS2M (Wind speed at 2 meters above ground level): This tells us how fast the wind is blowing about two meters above the ground. If it says 5 m/s, it means the wind is blowing quickly, like when you feel a nice breeze on your face.
5. ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN (Downward solar radiation at the surface): This tells us how much sunlight is hitting the ground. If it says 400 W/m², it means a lot of sunlight is shining down, like on a bright, sunny day.
6. TMAX (Maximum Temperature): This is the hottest temperature of the day. If it’s 30°C, it was really warm at some point during the day.
7. TMIN (Minimum Temperature): This is the coldest temperature of the day. If it says 10°C, it means it was pretty chilly during the night.
8. PS (Surface Pressure): This tells us about the weight of the air above us. If the pressure is high, it means the air is heavy, which can help keep the weather clear.
9. QV10M (Specific Humidity at 10 meters): This is like RH2M but tells us how much moisture is in the air at a height of 10 meters.
10. SNODP (Snow Depth): This tells us how deep the snow is on the ground. If it says 15 cm, it means there’s a little bit of snow covering the ground.
11. TS (Surface Skin Temperature): This tells us how warm the ground is. If it’s 25 K (Kelvin), we need to convert it to Celsius, but it helps us know if the ground is warm or cold.
12. U10M, U2M, U50M (Zonal Wind Speed): These tell us how fast the wind is blowing in a straight line (west to east) at different heights (10, 2, and 50 meters above the ground).
13. V10M, V2M (Meridional Wind Speed): These tell us how fast the wind is blowing up and down (north to south) at different heights (10 and 2 meters above the ground).
14. PSC (Probability of Scattering Cloud): This tells us how likely it is that there are clouds in the sky. If it’s 70%, it means it’s pretty likely you’ll see clouds.
15. WD10M, WD2M (Wind Direction): These tell us where the wind is coming from at 10 and 2 meters above the ground. If it says 90°, it means the wind is coming from the east.
16. WS10M (Wind Speed at 10 meters): This tells us how fast the wind is blowing at a height of 10 meters.
